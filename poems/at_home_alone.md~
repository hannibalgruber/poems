# At Home Alone

< !--
Alone at home.
Pictures of son and dead husband
son works at local radio station
daily life - watches the news, listens to records, looking out window
sees police officers walking down street
doesn't go outside - doesn't get visits
new neighbor seems to have moved in outside
occasionally heard neighbor who lives in apartment above her
watches neighbor arrive back at night
neighbor looks like tough security guard
neighbor doesn't like her watching him
neighbor makes a lot of noise during the night
woman finds record she has never seen before
contains recording of husband whispering indistinctly
neighbor starts knocking on her window when he comes back from work at night
neighbor seen talking with police officer
woman becomes increasingly paranoid
hears husband warn her of man
woman finds recorders in her home
tears it down, scared to call police
police stare at hear as they walk past her house
shutters windows and locks doors
neighbor becomes very loud, scraping metal along his floor
finds wires planted in her head beneath her hair
cuts all her hair
can hear her thoughts being broadcast to radio in neighbor's apartment
